# This is an example of a file which may be supplied to bash's
# --rcfile option, as is done by
# twinax_login_custom_terminfo_and_bashrc.

# Start with the normal file, then undo things which don't work
# properly with a VT52-like terminal.  Rather than do this, it may be
# example to just apply desired settings here.  Modifying ~/.bashrc to
# apply different settings when $TERM is set to vt52 or $TWINAXTERM is
# set would also work.

# These are defined with unwanted --color=auto options:
unalias egrep
unalias fgrep
unalias grep

# If 5250_terminal.py is started under X, since $DISPLAY is still set,
# running "emacs" will by default start it in the X session where
# 5250_terminal.py is running rather than in the TTY.  This alias
# works around that.  Another option would be to unset $DISPLAY.
alias emacs="emacs -nw"
